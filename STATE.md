# Operational State

Dynamic operational snapshot for cold-start orientation. Updated each session.

## Current Phase

**Production-validated.** aDNA v5.5 with hardened object standards, Canvas Standard v1.0.0, execution hierarchy v2 (OODA + AAR), 14 example lattices, and community infrastructure (contribution system, side-quests, vision document). aDNA Standard v2.2 (maintenance pass complete).

## What's Working

- aDNA triad deployed (what/how/who, 5 governance files, 14 base entity types)
- Object standards hardened: module, dataset, lattice (targets as dataset subtype)
- Canvas Standard v1.0.0 with Round-Trip Protocol v1.0 (YAML authoritative, canvas as view layer)
- Type vocabulary: 19 canonical I/O types (Decision 10)
- FAIR metadata: flat↔nested envelope interconversion (Decision 11)
- `.dataset.yaml` schema: multi-cloud storage, 7 providers, FUSE support (Decision 12)
- Lattice YAML validation tool (`lattice_validate.py`) + JSON Schema
- Canvas-YAML bidirectional conversion (`lattice2canvas.py`, `canvas2lattice.py`)
- 13 example lattice files + 3 canvas templates + 1 demonstration canvas
- Context library: 4 topics, 23 subtopics, ~58K tokens (prompt_engineering, adna_core, lattice_basics, object_standards)
- Sync protocol: vault↔repo `adna_core/` sync (backlog: formal sync skill not yet created)
- Cross-topic recipe system: 6 domain-neutral recipes with 3-tier budgets
- Execution hierarchy v2: OODA cascade (3-level), AAR protocol (5-step), mission classes (5 types)
- Quality framework: 6-axis rubric, quality audit skill, context graduation pipeline
- Strategic compass template + escalation cascade (session→mission→campaign→STATE.md)
- 20 templates including AAR, strategic compass, campaign CLAUDE.md, registry, data record, folder note, PRD, RFC, migration, side quest, quest result
- R&D→PRD→RFC planning pipeline (4 stages)
- Agent-driven onboarding (`how/skills/skill_onboarding.md`) — runs in forked projects, not base template
- Template detection + project fork flow (`role: template` in MANIFEST.md, `skill_project_fork.md`)
- `~/lattice/` workspace convention for L0 node bootstrap
- 7 skills (project fork, onboarding, lattice publish, new entity type, context quality audit, context graduation, vault review)
- Session tracking, mission/campaign/backlog systems
- 10 CSS snippets for Obsidian visual polish
- CHANGELOG.md with version policy and migration cross-links
- CONTRIBUTING.md with Agent Contribution Mode (organic upstream contribution)
- Upstream contribution skill (`how/skills/skill_upstream_contribution.md`)
- Side-quest infrastructure: quest specs, result templates, aggregation tool (`how/quests/`, `what/lattices/tools/`)
- `who/governance/VISION.md` — decentralized frontier lab model with participation ladder

## Active Blockers

None.

## Next Steps

1. **Clone into `~/lattice/`** — `mkdir -p ~/lattice && cd ~/lattice && git clone https://github.com/LatticeProtocol/adna.git`
2. **Run Claude Code** in `~/lattice/adna/` — the agent detects this is the base template, creates your workspace, and helps fork your first project
3. **Or customize manually** — fork `adna/` to a project directory, edit MANIFEST.md, STATE.md, and CLAUDE.md § Identity with your project identity
4. **Extend the ontology** — add domain-specific directories under who/what/how (see README § Extending the Ontology, or load `ontology_workshop` context)
5. **Explore the context library** — read `what/context/AGENTS.md` for topic index, or check `context_recipes.md` for pre-built assemblies
6. **Build a lattice** — copy an example from `what/lattices/examples/` and customize it

## Partial-Resume Detection

**Template** (`role: template` in MANIFEST.md): This is the base template. It should never enter partial-resume state — onboarding runs in forked projects, not here.

**Forked project** (no `role` field): If session history is non-empty but MANIFEST.md still shows `last_edited_by: agent_init`, onboarding was started but governance was not customized. Read `how/skills/skill_onboarding.md` and resume from the first step that hasn't produced output (check for customized MANIFEST.md, personalized CLAUDE.md § Identity, and updated STATE.md).
